# VGGI
VISUALIZATION OF GRAPHICAL AND GEOMETRIC INFORMATION

Practical assignment #2

Requirements: 
   Use sources from Practical assignment #1 adding new functionality as follows:
      Implement vertex and pixel shaders that calculate intensity of illumination for the surface coming from a single light source:    
        Irgb=Ambient+Diffuse+Specular
      Make sure the surface is rendered with filled polygons (triangles).
